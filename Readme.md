# Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Pandemic Forecasting

This project builds upon the original [Transfer Graph Neural Networks for Pandemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08388) by integrating new features and methodologies as part of the **CS519 (Machine Learning on Graphs)** course at the **University of Illinois Chicago** under Professor **Saurav Medya**.

## Abstract

Pandemic forecasting is a complex task requiring models that integrate diverse data sources. Traditional approaches often fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of pandemics. This project enhances the original GNN-based framework by incorporating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for contextual understanding and improving time-series predictions. These advancements demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

## New Features and Contributions

This enhanced framework introduces the following features:

1. **Integration of LLM-Derived Contextual Embeddings**  
   - Added a module to extract and process contextual signals from news articles, social media posts, and policy documents.  
   - Enriched node features using embeddings generated by transformer-based models like BERT and sentiment analysis tools.  
   - Scaled and appended contextual features to GNN inputs.

2. **Quantized Time-Series Data for LLM Processing**  
   - Converted numeric time-series data into token-like formats using clustering techniques.  
   - Enabled LLMs to process structured numeric data, bridging the gap between structured and textual inputs.  

3. **Prompt Engineering for Region-Specific Predictions**  
   - Developed techniques for LLMs to generate region-specific forecasts using tailored prompts.  
   - Enhanced interpretability and domain alignment with GNN predictions.

4. **Improved GNN Architectures**  
   - Implemented advanced GNN variants like GAT with attention mechanisms and temporal modeling using LSTM layers.  
   - Enhanced the adaptability of models to changing pandemic dynamics.

5. **Comprehensive Validation**  
   - Empirically validated the new methods using COVID-19 data from Italian regions.  
   - Demonstrated performance improvements across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, R²).

## Data Sources

- **Labels**  
   Ground truth for confirmed cases is sourced from open datasets for Italy, England, France, and Spain. Processed data is included in the `data` folder.

- **Graphs**  
   Mobility data derived from Facebook Data for Good disease prevention maps. Aggregated and anonymized mobility graphs are included for reproducibility.

- **Contextual Data**  
   Extracted from platforms like GNews, Twitter, and Reddit to provide rich insights into public sentiment and policy impacts.
